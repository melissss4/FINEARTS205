# FINEARTS205
objective: 
Keep code as simplified and short as possible
To keep code in the save, but not have it working use: control /

Using the p5.js primitive shapes, I experimented with the square and worked on changing the colour, changing the background, getting it to move and getting it to follow the mouse. Having 0 experience coding, I was able to see that this wasnâ€™t as daunting as I expected. This is the code I used to create the shape, colour it, and have it follow my mouse.
